Questions:

1.
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.
Constraints
1<= n <= 100
Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

2.
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

3.
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. 
The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

4.
The provided code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2.

5.
An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. 
It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

Task:
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. 
It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

Input Format
Read 'year', the year to test.
Constraints
1900 <= year <= 10^5
Output Format
The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.
Sample Input 0
1990
Sample Output 0
False
Explanation 0
1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.
